ðŸ“Š Orders by Weekday
This query calculates the number of unique orders (order_id) for each day of the week. It is useful for identifying which weekdays are the busiest for pizza orders.

Since the order_date column is stored as VARCHAR, we first convert it to a proper DATE format using TRY_CONVERT with style 103 (dd/MM/yyyy). Then, we extract the weekday name using DATENAME.

--Orders per weekday:
SELECT 
    DATENAME(WEEKDAY, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103)) AS weekday,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_per_day
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103));

ðŸ“Š Orders by Month
This query returns the number of unique orders (order_id) for each month based on the order_date field. It helps identify which months had the highest order volume.

--Orders per month:
SELECT 
    DATENAME(MONTH, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103)) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_per_month
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103))
ORDER BY order_per_month DESC;

ðŸ“Š Percentage of Total Sales by Pizza Category
This query calculates the percentage contribution of each pizza category to the total sales revenue.

The calculation is done by summing the total_price for each pizza_category, dividing it by the total sales across all categories, and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

--Percent of total sales by pizza category:
SELECT 
	pizza_category,
	CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS percent_tot_sales
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category 
ORDER BY percent_tot_sales;

ðŸ“Š Percentage of Total Sales by Pizza Size
This query calculates the percentage contribution of each pizza size to the overall sales revenue.

For each pizza_size, it sums the total_price, divides it by the total sales across all sizes, and multiplies by 100 to express the result as a percentage.

--Percent of total sales by pizza size:
SELECT 
    pizza_size,
    CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS percent_tot_sales
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY percent_tot_sales DESC;
