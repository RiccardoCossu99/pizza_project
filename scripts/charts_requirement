ðŸ“Š Orders by Weekday
This query calculates the number of unique orders (order_id) for each day of the week. It is useful for identifying which weekdays are the busiest for pizza orders.

Since the order_date column is stored as VARCHAR, we first convert it to a proper DATE format using TRY_CONVERT with style 103 (dd/MM/yyyy). Then, we extract the weekday name using DATENAME.

--Orders per weekday:
SELECT 
    DATENAME(WEEKDAY, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103)) AS weekday,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_per_day
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(WEEKDAY, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103));

ðŸ“Š Orders by Month
This query returns the number of unique orders (order_id) for each month based on the order_date field. It helps identify which months had the highest order volume.

--Orders per month:
SELECT 
    DATENAME(MONTH, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103)) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_per_month
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, TRY_CONVERT(DATE, order_date, 103))
ORDER BY order_per_month DESC;
